# How to use SteamRandomProfile?
You can use this as a Firefox addon or you can use the code as a userscript and use it on other browsers if you need it! (But I did not test on other browsers outside Firefox)

## As a firefox addon
- Get the source code (You can use Git clone or download it) from https://github.com/MrGameandCode/SteamRandomProfile
- Create a zip file, with icons folder, manifest.json, test.js and README.md
- Go to about:addons
- Press the gear icon, chose "install addon from file..." and then pick the zip file.
- Congrats! Now you have the addon installed on your firefox :)

## As a userscript
- Go to yout userscript and create a new script
- Copy the contents of test.js there (please, don't forget to put that you got the code from https://github.com/MrGameandCode/SteamRandomProfile in a comment, like "//Got this code from https://github.com/MrGameandCode/SteamRandomProfile")
- On the section when your userscipt client check when to apply this code, put "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/*"
- Congrats! Now you have this code working as your userscript
